Generating .vcf file for each users:
  1) Obtain the data from the csv file previously created;
  
     1.1) To generate data, open the previously created csvfile.
     1.2) Append the whole data to a list to create a list of worker details this is done to easily iterate through data.
     1.3) Return the list of data created.
     
  2) Generate vcs for each worker:
     2.1) Acquire the details of workers generated on the previous step.
     2.2) To obtain the .vcf detailed file for each worker use for loop.
     2.3) Inside the for loop open the vcs file for each user with file name as 'mail id' of each user, this will generate 100 .vcf files.
     2.4) The .vcf files are stored in a directory defined in the program, while running the program first create the folder in the 
          same directory as the program is stored and the .vcf fileds will be added to this directory
     
  3) Wrie a main functiion:
     3.1) Store csv file name in a variable, csv file name is passed as command line argument.
     3.2) Details from 'step 1' needs to be stored in a variable and pass this variable to the second step as data.
